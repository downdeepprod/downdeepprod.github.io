      <p>
        My name is Josh Friese. I'm a software developer living in RDU, North Carolina.
        I work in Python and Django.

        <div class="block1">
        <p>When I was about 14 years old, I made my first blog on Tumblr. Around that time, teenagers managing photography blogs was a big thing and I loved every second of it. Tumblr allowed for a great level of expression that I now understand why people that age could spend hours upon hours browsing, posting, reblogging and, most of all, editing their themes. Or maybe that was just me... </p>
        <p>I started messing around heavily with other codes that were being posted around for everyone to use and eventually came upon my own product that I could send for use by other bloggers. Although I didn't fully understand what I was working with, I got a feel for the field of technology, something I've loved since I can remember.</p>
        <p>I now have a refined background in the service industry that came to be when I reached the legal working age. I took the diligent and responsive work ethic from that field and now employ into my work and training as a software developer.
